    h2 Search for terms in a list of often-used ontologies
    p Terms can be predicates, objects or the ontologies themselves. The index currently lists only a part of the spec. For a list of supported ontologies, refer to <router-link to="/about">the about section</router-link>.
    p This project is currently in alpha phase, basic functionality should be given, allthough users have to expect unhandled exceptions breaking the app. When in doubt, reload or <a href="https://github.com/tuelsch/whattheontology/issues">submit an issue</a>.
